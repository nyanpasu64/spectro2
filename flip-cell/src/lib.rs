/// An atomic value written on one thread and read on another without tearing.
///
/// You do not interact directly with a `FlipCell<T>`,
/// but instead a `FlipWriter<T>` and `FlipReader<T>`,
/// each of which can be sent to a different thread.
///
/// The writer has access to a non-aliased `&mut T` instance,
/// and can "publish" the value at any time, releasing it and obtaining a different `&mut T`.
/// The reader has access to a `&T` (in theory, `&mut` as well) unaffected by the writer thread,
/// but can "fetch" the latest value published by the writer at any time.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// `FlipCell` holds three `T` instances in an array, accessed via one writer and one reader struct.
/// The writer and reader each hold an "owning index" into the array,
/// which can be converted into a `&mut T` or `&T` (respectively) at any time.
/// This struct also holds an atomic value, composed of a third "shared index"
/// (owning an array entry which is not directly accessible),
/// and a bit-flag for whether the array entry was last owned by the writer or reader.
///
/// Internally, the writer or reader can atomically swap their "owning index" with the shared index,
/// using various memory orderings.
/// This transfers ownership of the T instances without moving them in memory.
///
/// # Public API
///
/// When the writer publishes a value written to its `&mut T`,
/// it unconditionally swaps its owning index into the shared index.
///
/// When the reader fetches the latest value,
/// it only swaps the shared index into its owning index
/// if the shared index's array entry was last owned by the writer.
/// Otherwise it does nothing (since the shared index points to a stale `T`
/// already seen earlier by the reader)
///
/// # Safety invariants
///
/// {shared_state & INDEX_MASK, FlipWriter.write_index, FlipReader.read_index}
/// must always be a permutation of 0..3.
