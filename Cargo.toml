[workspace]
# Adding a [workspace] key turns all path dependencies into workspace members.
# Excluding "3rdparty" or "3rdparty/*" fills my Cargo.lock with garbage
# (all features of dependencies, including transitive dependencies I don't use)...
# only ["3rdparty/foo-0.1.0", "3rdparty/bar-0.2.0"] doesn't.
